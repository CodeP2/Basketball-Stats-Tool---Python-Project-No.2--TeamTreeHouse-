I did clean up my code with pycodestyle

my_dic = {item['name']:item for item in players_copy} dosent work as I want wanted to make it all dic so I could easly access it through my_dic['experience'] for example but it didn't 
work as I wanted because the output was only 1st line of the list and thats is because it only returns keys but dosen't repeat them

height = player['height'].split()
player['height'] = int(height[0])
it does create a var named height and python splits string non int part while converting numbers to int I did it the same for the split for guardians and then used .join
so it will be a string and look nice 

if exp['experience'] is True and index <= 6:
was trying to use dictionary comprehension but it did create {"YES": True} instead so it was creating dic inside list which wasn't the outcome I wanted

as for the length of my code probably you could do some dic or list comprehensions but this is what I felt was best atm but if theres any adivse for the future how to
make it better I would appreciate because I want to write the best code I can and well not so long (I do assume I could create funtions to make it smaller but I didn't know
if that is allowed so I did only 2 functions I was asked for)

                for War_hei in Warriors:
                    sums += War_hei['height']
                    Warriors_height.append(sums)
                War_avg_hei = max(Warriors_height) / len(Warriors)
wanted to get the max val out of the loop and then divine it by len of the list so I will get the avrg height

                for guardians in Bandits:
                    Bandits_guardians.append(guardians['guardians'])
                print('Guardians:')
                print(', '.join(Bandits_guardians))
for this I had to use .join again because it did return a list not a str

also by using pystylecode I discovered I should use is for False or True instead of ==

I did import sys so I can make "quit" code line

not sure if I should explain the rest of the code but I will if that is required
